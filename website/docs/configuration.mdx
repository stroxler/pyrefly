# Pyrefly Configuration

Pyrefly has a basic configuration that can (or will) allow you to customize your
Pyrefly runs without having to specify all of your arguments on the command
line.

NOTE: this is early in its development, so the options listed here are subject
to change in name, usage, type, quantity, and structure.

Configurations can be specified in a [TOML file](https://toml.io/en/) at the root of
your project (or elsewhere, as long as the path-based config options point to the right place) named
`pyrefly.toml`, with all configuration options in the top-level of the document.
You can also specify a configuration in a `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.pyrefly]`
section. Other config names can be used when explicitly passing in the config file
name with the `--config`/`-c` flag, but they will not be automatically found by
[Configuration Finding](#configuration-finding).

Both absolute and config-relative paths are supported.

## Simple Configuration Example

Here's an example of a simple config. To see more complex examples,
including in a `pyproject.toml`, look at
[Example Configurations](#example-configurations), which show Pyrefly's default
config, as well as other ways you can set your configuration.

```toml
# set the directory Pyrefly will search for files to type check
project-includes = [
    "a", "b/c/d", "e"
]

# manually set the `sys.platform` Pyrefly will assume when type checking
python-platform = "linux"

# return an import error when `<library>-stubs` can be imported, but no
# non-stubs version of that library can be found
ignore-missing-source = false

# a table mapping error codes to an `is-enabled` boolean
[errors]
# disable `bad-assignment` errors
bad-assignment = false
# disable `bad-return` errors
bad-return = false
```

## Precedence in Options

[Configuration options](#configuration-options) are selected in the following order

1. CLI flags
    * Examples: `--project-excludes <value>`, `--python-version <value>`
2. Environment variable overrides -- this is the same as `PYREFLY_<config option name>`
    * Examples: `export PROJECT_EXCLUDES=<value>`, `PYTHON_VERSION=<value> pyrefly ...`
3. Configuration options
    * Examples: (in a `pyrefly.toml`) `project-excludes = <value>`, `python-version = <value>`
4. Pyrefly defaults
    * See [Default `pyrefly.toml`](#default-pyreflytoml) for the default values used

## Type Checking Modes

Pyrefly has two different modes it can run in when type checking your project, which
correspond to different but useful ways we expect most people to interact with Pyrefly:

- **Project** mode: attempt to load a config, falling back to Pyrefly's default config when
  none can be found, and type check using that one config. This involves getting the
  [`project-includes`](#project-includes) and [`project-excludes`](#project-excludes) from the file, expanding the patterns,
  and type checking on those files.
  - Project mode is used whenever no files are provided with the CLI invocation.
- **Per-file** or **Single-file** mode: when given [`FILES...`](#project-includes) (and optionally [`--project-excludes`](#project-excludes))
  during a CLI invocation, expand the patterns and find the relevant config file for each
  file listed. `project-includes` and `project-excludes` are ignored from the config file,
  but it is used for all remaining config options.

## Configuration Finding

In both project checking mode and single-file checking mode (see [Type Checking Modes](#type-checking-modes)
for more info), we attempt to find a *project root* from which to check each file, both for reading
config options and for import resolution. The project root is typically the directory containing the
configuration file. More precisely:

1. If a configuration file is provided with `-c`/`--config`, we use the directory the file is located in as the directory to check.
2. If no configuration file is passed, we perform an upward file search from the 'start location' to the filesystem root,
   looking in each directory for any of the following files: `pyrefly.toml`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `setup.py`, `mypy.ini`, and `pyrightconfig.json`. If we find one, we use the directory it's found in as the containing directory.
3. If no configuration file is found, we will still attempt to resolve imports by walking up the tree looking for a matching import. For example: when
   importing `from a.b.c import q`, if our project structure
   looks like `/x/y/z/a/b/c`, we can walk up the components of `a.b.c` to find a root at
   `/x/y/z`.


Note that only `pyrefly.toml` and `pyproject.toml` are parsed for config options, but we look for
additional files that mark the root of a project to aid import resolution.

For project checking mode, the 'start location' is current working directory. For single-file checking mode,
the start location is the directory containing each file to be type checked, and
we find the config for each file matched by the pattern provided.

If a `pyrefly.toml` is found, it is parsed and used for type checking, and will
return an error to the user on invalid types, syntax, values, or unknown config options.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found, Pyrefly will use the `[tool.pyrefly]`
section if it exists, otherwise it will assume a default config.
The same errors will be returned as when loading a `pyrefly.toml` if
the config is invalid.

### Providing a Config in Single-File Mode

Providing `-c`/`--config` in single-file checking mode disables the upward file search for config
files. All options are read from the provided config file except `project-includes` and
`project-excludes`, which are ignored.

## Configuration Options

The following section lists all recognized options that can be specified in a config
file or `pyproject.toml` Pyrefly config section.

### `project-includes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to type
check, typically understood as user-space files.

This does not specify
[Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx) priority or the path an
import should be resolved from. See [`search-path`](#search-path) instead.

- Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
- Default: `["**/*.py", "**/*.pyi"]`
- Flag equivalent: `FILES...` argument
- Equivalent configs: `include` in Pyright, `files`/`modules`/`packages` in
  mypy
- Notes:
  - When overridden by passing in `FILES...`, we do not consult the
    relevant config file for what to use for `project-excludes`. If
    `project-excludes` should not use the default value, override it with the flag as
    well.
  - When a `project-includes` pattern does not match any files, we will return
    an error.
  - If you get an error about no matches for a directory when passing a glob as a CLI
    argument, try wrapping the glob in quotes to prevent eager shell glob expansion.

### `project-excludes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to avoid
type checking as way to filter files that match `project-includes`,
but we don't want to type check.

- Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
- Default: `["**/.[!/.]*", "**/*venv/**"]`
- Flag equivalent: `--project-excludes`
- Equivalent configs: `exclude` in Pyright and mypy
- Notes:
  - It is an error if no files are returned from any `project-includes` because
    they are filtered out by `project-excludes` entries. We differentiate between
    an error from a `project-includes` that doesn't match any files, and an error
    from all `project-includes` getting filtered by `project-excludes`.
  - When passing in `FILES...`, we also do not consult the config file for
    what to use for `project-excludes`. If `project-excludes` should not use
    the default value, override it with a flag as well. When no `FILES...` are passed,
    `project-excludes` overrides the config's value.
  - Your [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) is added to your `project-excludes`
    automatically. If you are trying to perform type checking on a dependency in your
    `site-package-path` (i.e. `cd <site-package-path>/some_dependency && pyrefly check`),
    we recommend you pull and set up your dependency from GitHub, but you can achieve
    this on files in your `site-package-path` by setting `site-package-path = []` in
    your config.

### `search-path`

A file path describing the roots from which imports should be
found and imported from (including modules in [`project-includes`](#project-includes)). This takes
the [highest precedence in import order](./import-resolution.mdx#absolute-imports),
before `typeshed` and [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path). When a `project-includes`
type checked file is imported by another type checked file, we check all search roots to
determine how to import it.

- Type: list of directories specifying the root
- Default: [import root](./import-resolution.mdx#import-root)
- Flag equivalent: `--search-path`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_SEARCH_PATH`
- Equivalent configs: `extraPaths` in Pyright, `mypy_path` in mypy
- Notes:
  - We automatically append an import root (typically the directory containing the
    configuration file) to the `search-roots` when type checking as a sensible
    default and last attempt at an import.
  - Libraries should not be listed here, since they may override `typeshed`
    values for your whole project, and have different import semantics with
    respect to typing. See
    [Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx)
    for more information about how modules are imported.

### `site-package-path`

A file path describing a root from which imports should
be found and imported from. This takes the lowest priority in import
resolution, after [`search-path`](#search-path) and `typeshed`.

`site-package-path` entries have special rules around when they can be imported,
according to the typing specification. See
[Site Package Path Typing Rules](./import-resolution.mdx#site-package-path-typing-rules)
for more information, and [`use-untyped-imports`](#use-untyped-imports) and
[`ignore-missing-source`](#ignore-missing-source) for details on how to configure
that behavior.

- Type: list of directories
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `[]` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--site-package-path`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH`
- Equivalent configs: none

NOTE: Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
to be reused between different systems and platforms.

### `python-platform`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform)
values.

- Type: string
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  "linux" if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--python-platform`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_PLATFORM`
- Equivalent configs: `pythonPlatform` in Pyright, `platform` in mypy

### `python-version`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version)
values. The format should be `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`, where minor and
micro can be omitted to take the default positional value.

- Type: string of the format `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `3.13.0` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--python-version`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_VERSION`
- Equivalent configs: `pythonVersion` in Pyright, `python_version` in mypy

### `conda-environment`

The name of the Conda environment to query when attempting to autoconfigure
Python environment values (`site-package-path`, `python-platform`, `python-version`).
See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more
information. We query Conda with `conda info --envs`, then find the environment's interpreter in Environment Autoconfirugration.

We will query Conda for information about this environment, even when it's not sourced,
unless a Python environment (venv, Conda) is activated or `--python-interpreter` or
`--conda-environment` are passed in through the CLI.

This configuration option **is mutually exclusive with `python-interpreter` and `skip-interpreter-query`**.

- Type: string of existing Conda environment name
- Default: none
- Flag equivalent: `--conda-environment`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT`
- Equivalent configs: none
- Notes:
    - This enables the use of a non-local but customizable global environment without having to hard-code a path, which is not preferable on a shared project.

### `python-interpreter`

The Python interpreter to query when attempting to autoconfigure
Python environment values (`site-package-path`, `python-platform`, `python-version`).
See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more information.

This configuration option **is mutually exclusive with `conda-environment` and `skip-interpreter-query`**.

- Type: path to executable
- Default: `$(which python3)`, then `$(which python)`, or none
- Flag equivalent: `--python-interpreter`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_INTERPRETER`
- Equivalent configs: `python_executable` in mypy
- Notes:
  - This executes the value present in the `python-interpreter` field without any checks. It could
    be a security risk if your `python-interpreter` is an arbitrary executable.
  - If you don't have a Python interpreter installed on your machine, we'll output an
    error letting you that we couldn't appropriately configure your environment.
    Configure `skip-interpreter-query` to skip the check and avoid the error.

NOTE: Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
to be reused between different systems and platforms.

### `skip-interpreter-query`

Skip querying any interpreters and do not do any 
[Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration). This means that
Pyrefly will take hard-coded defaults for [`python-version`](#python-version`)
and [`python-platform`](#python-platform), and will use an empty
[`site-package-path`](#site-package-path). It's likely you'll want to override
these to match the environment you'll be running in.

This configuration option **is mutually exclusive with `python-interpreter` and `conda-environment`**.

- Type: bool
- Default: `false`
- Flag equivalent: `--skip-interpreter-query`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_SKIP_INTERPRETER_QUERY`

### `errors`

Configure (enable and disable) the errors Pyrefly emits. `true` (default) tells Pyrefly to
emit the error, while `false` tells Pyrefly to hide it.

- Type: Table of [error code](./error-kinds.mdx) to boolean representing enabled status
- Default: `errors = {}`/`[errors]`
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs:
  [type check rule overrides](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-rule-overrides)
  and [type evaluation settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-evaluation-settings)
  in Pyright,
  [`enable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-enable_error_code) and
  [`disable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disable_error_code)
  in mypy
- Notes: setting `<error-code> = true` is the same as having no error code configuration present, which means
  the error will be shown. Setting `<error-code> = false` will disable the error for type checking.

### `replace-imports-with-any`

[`ModuleGlob`](#module-globbing)s of modules from which import errors should be
ignored, and the module should be replaced with `typing.Any`. For example, with
`from x.y import z` in a file, adding `x.*`, `*.y`, or `x.y` to this config will
silence those import errors and replace the module with `typing.Any`. If the module can be found, its type
information will still be replaced with `typing.Any`.

- Type: list of regex
- Default: `[]`
- Flag equivalent: `--replace-imports-with-any`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_REPLACE_IMPORTS_WITH_ANY`
- Equivalent configs: `ignore_missing_imports` or `follow_imports = skip` in mypy
- Notes:
  - `errors = {import-error = false}` (TOML inline table for `errors`) has similar behavior in Pyrefly, but ignores
    *all* import errors instead of import errors from specific modules, and won't replace findable modules with `typing.Any`.

### `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`

Whether to ignore type errors in generated code. If enabled, generated files
will be treated as if they are included in `project-excludes`.
The generated code status is determined by checking if the file contents contain
the substring '<span>&#64;</span>generated'.

- Type: bool
- Default: `false`
- Flag equivalent: `--ignore-errors-in-generated-code`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_IGNORE_ERRORS_IN_GENERATED_CODE`
- Equivalent configs: none

### `use-untyped-imports`

Whether to search imports in [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) that do not have a
`py.typed` file unconditionally. When this is true, we skip any checks for `py.typed` files,
and return the first valid import we can find. See
[Site Package Path Typing Rules](./import-resolution.mdx#site-package-path-typing-rules) for
more information on when a `site-package-path` cannot be used for typing information.

- Type: bool
- Default: `true`
- Flag equivalent: `--use-untyped-imports`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_USE_UNTYPED_IMPORTS`
- Equivalent configs: `useLibraryCodeForTypes` in Pyright, `follow_untyped_imports` in mypy

### `ignore-missing-source`

Whether to skip the check for a non-stubs package when a `-stubs` package is found in
[`site-package-path`](#site-package-path). When this is true, we immediately return
a `-stubs` package when found.

The check for a non-stubs package exists to ensure you have an importable package to use
in your project. When this check returns an import error, it means we couldn't find a package,
and that at runtime you may not actually be able to import the given package, even if its
type stubs could be found. See
[Stub Files vs Source Files](./import-resolution.mdx#stub-files-vs-source-files) for more information.

- Type: bool
- Default: `true`
- Flag equivalent: `--ignore-missing-source`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_IGNORE_MISSING_SOURCE`
- Equivalent configs: `reportMissingModuleSource` in Pyright

### `untyped-def-behavior`

How should Pyrefly treat function definitions with no parameter or return type annotations?

By default, Pyrefly uses the `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior and will
check all function bodies inferring the return type.

If this option is set to `"check-and-infer-return-any"`, then Pyrefly will still
check the function body but will treat the return type as `Any`.

If this option is set to `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`, Pyrefly will again treat
the return type as `Any`, but will also skip checking the function body. In this
case, Pyrefly will also infer `Any` as the type of any attributes inferred based
on this function body. This behavior is what PEP 484 specifies, although we do
not recommend it for most users today; since Pyrefly will not analyze the bodies
of untyped functions, language server functionality like showing types on hover
and finding definitions will not be available there.

- Type: one of `"check-and-infer-return-type"`, `"check-and-infer-return-any"`,
  `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`
- Default: `"check-and-infer-return-type"
- Flag equivalent: `--untyped-def-behavior`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_UNTYPED_DEF_BEHAVIOR`
- Equivalent configs:
  - The `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior emulates Pyright's default
    behavior.
  - The `"skip-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's default behavior.
  - The `"check-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's
    `check_untyped_defs` flag.


### `permissive-ignores`

Should Pyrefly ignore errors based on annotations from other tools, e.g. `# pyre-ignore` or `# mypy: ignore`?
By default, respects `# pyrefly: ignore` and `# type: ignore`.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`
- Flag equivalent: `--permissive-ignores`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PERMISSIVE_IGNORES`

### `sub-config`

Override specific config values for matched paths in your project. See
[`SubConfigs`](#subconfigs) for more information on the structure
and values that can be overridden here.

- Type: [TOML array of tables](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables) with a [`SubConfig` structure](#subconfigs)
- Default: `[]`
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs: `executionEnvironments` in Pyright, per-module config options in mypy

## Configuration Details

This section describes some of the configuration options, behaviors, or types in more depth, when
there are details shared between multiple config options or the information is more than what
can fit under a single config option description.

### Environment Autoconfiguration

Unless `skip-interpreter-query` is set, we'll attempt to query a Python interpreter to 
determine your [`python-platform`](#python-platform) or 
[`python-version`](#python-version) if they're unset. We also get a 
[`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) from your interpreter to determine which
packages you have installed and append those to the end of any `site-package-path`
you've configured yourself, either through CLI flags or a config file.

We look for an interpreter with the following logic:
1. Use [`python-interpreter`](#python-interpreter) or 
   [`conda-environment`](#conda-environment) if either are set by a flag.
   Both cannot be set in flags at the same time.
2. Determine if there's an active `venv` or `conda` environment. If both are active at 
   the same time, we take `venv` over `conda`.
3. Use [`python-interpreter`](#python-interpreter) or 
   [`conda-environment`](#conda-environment) if either are set in a config file.
   Both cannot be set in a config at the same time.
4. Find a `venv` at the root of the project by searching for something that looks like a
   Python interpreter (matches `python(\d(\.\d+)?)?(.exe)?` regex), and looking
   for a `pyvenv.cfg` file in known locations. If we can't determine the root of your
   project with a config file or other well-known root marker file (e.g. `setup.py`, `pyrightconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`), this step is skipped.
4. Query `$(which python3)` and `$(which python)` (platform independent) to use
   a system-installed interpreter.
5. Fall back to Pyrefly's default values for any unspecified config options.

The config options we query the interpreter for are:
* `python-platform`: `sys.platform`
* `python-version`: `sys.version_info[:3]`
* `site-package-path`: `site.getsitepackages() + [site.getusersitepackages()]`

:::info
You can run `pyrefly dump-config` and pass in your file or configuration like you would
with `pyrefly check` to see what Pyrefly finds for your Python interpreter and
`site-package-path`, along with other useful config-debugging features.
:::

### Filesystem Globbing

We use a standard Unix-style glob, which allows for wildcard matching when specifying a fileset. It is similar
to regex, but more restricted given the subset of allowed syntax for paths on a filesystem. We currently only
allow matching files with a `.py` or `.pyi` suffix.

The globs provided are relative to the config, if one is found, or the current working directory otherwise.
Absolute path globs can also be provided, though this is generally not recommended, since it may not
be compatible with other systems type checking your project.

- We recognize the following wildcards:
  - `*` matches zero or more characters in a single directory component
  - `**` matches the current and any sub directories/files in those sub directories
  - `?` matches any one character
  - `[<pattern>]` matches any character or character range between the brackets (character range separated by `-`)
  - `[!<pattern>]` excludes any character or character range between the brackets and after the `!`
  - Note: `[]` can be used to match `?`, `*`, `[`, `]` literally (e.g. `[?]`), although these are invalid as part of a Python path.

We also support non-wildcard paths, so a relative (or absolute) path like `src/` will match all Python files under `src/`
or `src/my_file.py` will match `src/my_file.py` exactly.

Any directories matched will also have their `.py` and `.pyi` files recursively matched. `src/*` will match all files and
directories under `src/`, so therefore, we will recursively match everything under `src/`.

Examples:
- `src/**/*.py`: only match `.py` files under `src/`
- `src`, `src/`, `src/*`, `src/**`, and `src/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files under `src/
- `?.py` and `[A-z].py`: match any file that looks like `<letter>.py`
- `src/path/to/my/file.py`: only match `src/path/to/my/file.py`
- `src/**/tests`, `src/**/tests/`, `src/**/tests/**`, and `src/**/tests/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files in `src/`
  under a directory named `tests`

### Module Globbing

In some config options, we've added globbing for module paths. This is different from both path globs and regex,
in the sense that we're performing a match on a Python dotted import, such as `this.is.any.module`.
The only wildcard we recognize is `*`, which represents zero or more segments of a module path, unless it starts a glob,
in which case it must match one or more segments. The wildcard must be surrounded
by `.`, unless it is at the start or end of a module glob.

Examples:
- `this.is.a.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is\.a\.module`. It will only match imports that look like
`this.is.a.module`.
- `this.is.*.module` would become `^this\.is(\..+)*\.module$`. It would match:
  - `this.is.module`
  - `this.is.a.module`
  - `this.is.a.really.long.path.to.a.module`
- `*.my.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^.+\.my\.module$`.
  - It would match:
    - `this.is.my.module`
    - `heres.my.module`
  - It will not match:
    - `my.module`
- `this.is.*` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is(\..+)*`. It would match:
  - `this.is.my.module`
  - `this.is`

### `SubConfigs`

`SubConfigs` are a method for overriding one or more config options for specific files based on
filepath glob matching. Only certain config options are allowed to be overridden, and a need
to override other configs means you likely need to use a separate config file for your subdirectory.
You can have as many `SubConfigs` as you want in a project, and even multiple separate `SubConfigs`
that can apply to a given file when the `matches` glob pattern matches.

#### `SubConfig` Allowed Overrides

We currently allow the following config options to be overridden in a `SubConfig`:
- `errors`
- `replace-imports-with-any`
- `untyped-def-behavior`
- `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`

All `SubConfig` overrides *replace* the values appearing in the 'root' or top-level of the
Pyrefly configuration.

Any configs that change the list of files we're type checking, Python environment, or where we look
for imports cannot be included in `SubConfigs`. Some other configs we also do not include because
we think they make it difficult to reason about your project type checks, but you can
[open an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or make a pull request if you disagree
and would like to see the option supported.

#### `SubConfig` Table Structure

A `SubConfig` has two or more entries:
- a `matches` key, with a [Filesystem Glob](#filesystem-globbing) detailing which files the config
  applies to.
- at least one of the [`SubConfig` allowed overrides](#subconfig-allowed-overrides)

#### `SubConfig` Option Selection

Since you can have more than one `SubConfig` matching a file, we need to define a resolution order
to determine which `SubConfig`'s option should be selected. Pyrefly does this by filtering
`SubConfig`s whose `matches` does not match the given file, then takes the first non-null
value that can be found in the order the `SubConfig`s appear in your configuration.

If no `SubConfig`s match, or there are no non-null config options present, then we take
the value in the 'root'/top-level Pyrefly config (or Pyrefly default if no value is specified).

### Conda and Venv Support

We plan on adding extra automatic support for [Conda](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/2)
and [Venv](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/1) at some point soon, but we haven't made
it around to doing this yet. If you would like to import packages from these in the meantime,
you can follow the following steps.

### Venv

If you have a venv set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your venv sourced
in your shell (`source .venv/bin/activate`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages. To pick
up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can add `.venv/bin/python3` (or
`<path_to_venv>/bin/python3`) to your Pyrefly configuration under
[`python-interpreter`](#python-interpreter) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter` flag.

### Conda

If you have conda set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your Conda environment
sourced in your shell (`conda activate <environment>`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages.
To pick up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can query your environment's install
location with `conda env list`, and add `<conda_environment_path>/bin/python3` to your Pyrefly configuration
under [`python-interpreter`](#python-interpreter) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter` flag.

## Example Configurations

This section displays an example config showing the usage of all config options listed above to make creating
your own easier, and to give you an easy place to start.

### Default `pyrefly.toml`

This is a configuration with the Pyrefly defaults. If you have an
interpreter installed, some of these values may be overridden.

```toml
###### configuring what to type check and where to import from

# check all files in "."
project-includes = ["."]
# exclude dotfiles
project-excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*", "**/*venv/**"]
# import project files from "."
search-path = ["."]
# do not include any third-party packages
site-package-path = []

###### configuring your python environment

# assume we're running on linux, regardless of the actual current platform
python-platform = "linux"
# assume the Python version we're using is 3.13, without querying an interpreter
python-version = "3.13"
# query the default Python interpreter on your system, if installed and `python_platform`,
# `python-version`, or `site-package-path` are unset.
# python-interpreter = null # this is commented out because there are no `null` values in TOML

#### configuring your type check settings

replace-imports-with-any = []
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = false
use-untyped-imports = false
ignore-missing-source = false

[errors]
# this is an empty table, meaning all errors are enabled by default

# no `[[sub-config]]` entries are included, since there are none by default
```

### Example `pyrefly.toml`

```toml
project-includes = ["src"]
project-excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*", "**/tests"]
search-path = ["src"]
site-package-path = ["venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages"]

python-platform = "linux"
python-version = "3.12"
python-interpreter = "venv/bin/python3"

replace-imports-with-any = [
  "sympy.*",
  "*.series",
]
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = true
use-untyped-imports = true
ignore-missing-source = true

# disable `bad-assignment` and `invalid-argument` for the whole project
[errors]
bad-assignment = false
invalid-argument = false

[[sub-config]]
# apply this to `sub/project/tests/file.py`
matches = "sub/project/tests/file.py"

# any unittest imports will by typed as `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = ["unittest.*"]

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files in `sub/project`
matches = "sub/project/**"

# enable `assert-type` errors in `sub/project`
[sub-config.errors]
assert-type = true

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files in `sub`
matches = "sub/**`

# disable `assert-type` errors in `sub`
[sub-config.errors]
assert-type = false

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files under `tests` dirs in `sub/`
matches = "sub/**/tests/**"

# any pytest imports will be typed as `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = ["pytest.*"]
```

With the above config, here are the actual config values some files would use:
- `sub/project/tests/file.py`
  - `replace-imports-with-any`: `["unittest.*"]`
  - `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  - `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
  - `use-untyped-imports`: `true`
- `sub/project/tests/another_file.py`
  - `replace-imports-with-any`: `["pytest.*"]`
  - `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  - `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
  - `use-untyped-imports`: `true`
- `sub/project/non_test_file.py`
  - `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  - `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  - `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
  - `use-untyped-imports`: `true`
- `sub/sub_file.py`
  - `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  - `errors`: `{assert-type = false}`
  - `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
  - `use-untyped-imports`: `true`
- `top_level_file.py`
  - `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  - `errors`: `{assert-type = true, bad-assignment = false, invalid-argument = false}`
  - `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
  - `use-untyped-imports`: `true`

### Example `pyproject.toml`

```toml
...

# Pyrefly header
