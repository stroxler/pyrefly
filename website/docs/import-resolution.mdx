# Import Resolution

This doc describes how imports in a given file are found and their bindings are
resolved, including files that are being type checked.

NOTE: This document helps describe the internal behavior of Pyrefly and how we attempt to resolve imports. You should not need to know how this works to use Pyrefly but it may assist in debugging issues with Pyrefly not finding your imports. If you encounter a bug, please leave an issue for us on GitHub.

NOTE: see the [Configuration documentation](./configuration.mdx) for more info on
the config items referenced below.

## Relative Imports

If the import is relative (starting with one or more dots), the import is
resolved relative to the path of the file importing it. A single dot at the
beginning of the import (e.g. `.file.to.import`) represents the current
directory, and more dots (e.g. `..other.file`) will continue to walk upward.

## Absolute Imports

For absolute imports, Pyrefly uses the following import strategy:

1. Try to import from each entry in [`search_path`](./configuration.mdx#search_path) in the order they appear
   using the module finding strategy.
2. Try to import from `typeshed`.
3. Try to import implicit site packages. See the [implicit site packages section](#implicit-search-path)
4. Try to find a stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in
   [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path).
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
4. Try to find a non-stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in `site_package_path`.
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
5. Return an import error.

See [Site Package Path Typing Rules](#site-package-path-typing-rules) for more information about which
modules are valid imports from [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path), and
how to override that behavior.

### Implicit Search Path

Pyrefly will use the following heuristics to guess
the root of your project.

1. If we can find a Pyrefly config file using
   [configuration finding logic](./configuration.mdx#configuration-finding), we will automatically
   use that. When a configuration
   is found, we will add either a subdirectory named `src/`, or the found root as a
   [`search_path`](configuration.mdx#search_path) entry.
2. If we're looking for a specific import and can match components of its specific name
   with directories/files on the filesystem, we will use the root of the import as the
   project root. Example: when importing `from a.b.c import q`, if our project structure
   looks like `/x/y/z/a/b/c`, we can walk up the components of `a.b.c` to find a root at
   `/x/y/z`.
3. If the file we're importing is a non-namespace import, and we can't get it's parent
   directory, return a basic-default config with no heuristics. For example:
   ```
   # Assume we have a file called mymodule.py in the same directory
   import mymodule
   ```
4. Finally, with either the non-namespace import's parent directory or namespace import's
   immediate directory, walk up the filesystem and add each directory we find until
   root to the `fallback_search_path`.

### Site Package Path Typing Rules

When enabled with [`use_untyped_imports: false`](configuration.mdx#use_untyped_imports), we respect
typing rules as defined by the typing spec for
[stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-only-packages),
[partial stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#partial-stub-packages),
and [py.typed](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#packaging-type-information) files.
That means:
- if we can find any `-stubs` package, we do not fall back to non-stubs packages unless any of them contain a
  `py.typed` file in their top-level containing the content `partial\n`.
- if we can't find any `-stubs` packages, only accept a package's types if it contains a `py.typed` file. Here,
  we only check for the existence of the file, not for any contents.

You can control the above behavior with the following two configs:
- [`use_untyped_imports`](./configuration.mdx#use_untyped_imports): don't worry about looking for any `py.typed`
  file. Check for `-stubs` first and fall back to non-stubs, regardless of the presence of a `py.typed` with
  `partial\n` or if the non-stubs packages contain a `py.typed`.
- [`ignore_missing_source`](./configuration.mdx#ignore_missing_source): don't try to check for a backing non-stubs
  package when we find a `-stubs` package. Immediately return the `-stubs` package when found.

## Stub Files vs Source Files

A
[stub file](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files)
is any file that ends with a `.pyi` file suffix. They have many uses, including
adding typing to non-Python extension code, distributing typing information
separate from implementation, or overriding an implementation with more accurate
typing information.

A stub package is a second package corresponding to a regular package, with `-stubs`
appended to its name. A `-stubs` package should only include stub files (`.pyi`),
which override any `.py` or `.pyi` files in the non-stubs package. These are preferred
when available, since they contain the interfaces a library exposes to developers. An
example of this includes the popular library [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas),
and its stub package, [`pandas-stubs`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs).

When importing from a non-stubs package, Pyrefly loads typing information from
imports by first searching for a relevant `-stubs` package, then by looking at
the non-stubs package's `.pyi` files, then falls back to a `.py` file. See
[Absolute Imports](#absolute-imports) for details on when non-stubs packages
are allowed to be used for types, and how you can override that behavior.

## Editable Installs

When using static analysis tools with an editable install, the editable install should be configured to use `.pth`
files that contain file paths (`/project/src/module`) rather than executable lines (started with `import`) that
install import hooks. See [setuptools doc](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html)
and [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) for more information.

Import hooks can provide an editable installation that offers a more accurate representation of the actual installation
environment. However, since resolving module locations through an import hook
**requires executing Python code at runtime**, they are incompatible with Pyrefly and other static analysis tools that
operate without code execution. Consequently, when an editable install is configured to use import hooks, Pyrefly
will be unable to automatically locate and analyze the corresponding source files, resulting in incomplete type checking and
code analysis.

Setuptools build system uses import hooks by default for editable installations. To ensure compatibility between
setuptools-based editable installs and Pyrefly, setuptools must be configured to use path-based `.pth` files instead.
This configuration should be performed through the build frontend (such as `pip`) by specifying the appropriate
options during installation or in the project's configuration files.

### uv with setuptools

When using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with setuptools, uv can be
[configured](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#config-settings) to avoid import hooks.

NOTE: The `uv_build` backend always uses path-based `.pth` files.

### pip with setuptools
When using `pip` with setuptools-based projects, there are two ways to avoid import hooks:
[compat mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html#legacy-behavior)
and [strict mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html#strict-editable-installs).

### Hatch / Hatchling

[Hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/config/build/) uses path-based `.pth` files by default.
It will only use import hooks if you set [`dev-mode-exact` to true](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#dev-mode).

### PDM

[PDM](https://backend.pdm-project.org/) uses path-based `.pth` files by default.
It will only use import hooks if you set
[`editable-backend` to "editables"](https://backend.pdm-project.org/build_config/#choose-the-editable-build-format).

### Poetry / Poetry-core
[Poetry-core](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core) backend always uses path-based `.pth` files.

## Debugging Import Issues

Pyrefly has a `dump-config` command that dumps the import-related config options it is using for
each file it is checking. To use it, simply replace `check` with `dump-config` in your
command-line invocation.
