# Error Kinds

An _error kind_ categorizes an error by the part of the typing specification
that an error is related to. Every error has exactly one kind.

The main use of error kinds is as short names ("slugs") that can be used in
error suppression comments.

## annotation-mismatch

This error indicates a mismatch between multiple annotations for a single
variable. This is relatively uncommon, but it can happen in if-statements:

```python
if some_cond:
    x: int = 1
else:
    x: str = "two" # Inconsistent type annotations for x: str, int [annotation-mismatch]
```

It can be helpful to annotate the variable before branch, especially if there is
a useful default value for it. For example:

```python
x: str = "default"
if some_cond:
  x = "actual value"
```

## assert-type

An `assert-type` error is raised when a `typing.assert_type()` call fails.

This error kind should never be suppressed, since that rather defeats the point
of of `typing.assert_type()`.

## async-error

`async-error` is reported when attempting to `await` on something that is not
awaitable. This may indicate that a function should have been marked `async` but
wasn't.

```python
def some_func() -> None:
  ...

await some_func() # Expression is not awaitable [async-error]
```

This will also arise if the context manager used in an `async with` statement
has `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods that are not marked `async`.

The fix is to use an `async` function in the `await`. This may mean making the
function `async` or finding an existing `async` function to use instead.

## bad-argument-count

This error arises when a function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

```python
def takes_three(one: int, two: int, three: int) -> complex:
  ...

take_three(3, 2)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
```

Note that `missing-argument` will be raised if pyrefly can identify that
specific arguments are missing. As such, this error is more likely to appear
when too many args are supplied, rather than too few.

This example shows both kinds of errors:

```python
from typing import Callable
def apply(f: Callable[[int, int], int]) -> int:
    return f(1)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
apply() # Missing argument `f` in function `apply` [missing-argument]
```

## bad-argument-type

This error indicates that the function was called with an argument of the wrong
type.

```python
def example(x: int) -> None:
  ...
example("one")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter `x` with type `int` in function `example` [bad-argument-type]
```

This can also happen with `*args` and `**kwargs`:

```python
def bad_args(*args: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(1, "two")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter with type `int` in function `bad_args` [bad-argument-type]
```

```python
def bad_kwargs(**kwargs: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(x=1, y="two")  # Keyword argument `y` with type `Literal['two']` is not assignable to kwargs type `int` in function `bad_kwargs` [bad-argument-type]
```

## bad-assignment

The most common cause of this error is attempting to assign a value that conflicts with the variable's type annotation.

```python
x: str = 1 # `Literal[1]` is not assignable to `str` [bad-assignment]
```

However, it can occur in several other situations.

Here, `x` is marked as `Final`, so assigning a new value to it is an error.

```python
from typing import Final
x: Final = 1
x = 2 # `x` is marked final [bad-assignment]
```

In another case, attempting to annotate an assignment to an instance attribute raises this error.

```python
class A:
    x: int
a = A()
a.x: int = 2  # Type cannot be declared in assignment to non-self attribute `a.x` [bad-assignment]
```

## bad-class-definition

This error indicates that there is something wrong with the class definition.
It tends to be a bit rarer, since most issues would be tagged with other error kinds, such as
`annotation-mismatch` or one of the function errors.
inheritance has its own complexities, so it has its own error kind called `invalid-inheritance`.

One place you may see it is dynamic class generation:

```python
from enum import Enum
Ex = Enum("Ex", [("Red", 1), ("Blue", 2), ("Red", 3)])  # Duplicate field `Red` [bad-class-definition]
```

However, it is best practice to use the class syntax if possible, which doesn't treat duplicate names as an error.

## bad-function-definition

Like `bad-class-definition`, this error kind is uncommon because other error kinds are used for more specific issues.
For example, argument order is enforced by the parser, so `def f(x: int = 1, y: str)` is a `parse-error`.

## bad-instantiation

This error occurs when attempting to instantiate a class that cannot be instantiated, such as a protocol:

```python
from typing import Protocol
class C(Protocol): ...
C()  # bad-instantiation
```

## bad-keyword-argument

bad-keyword-argument pops up when a keyword argument is given multiple values:

```python
def f(x: int) -> None:
  pass
f(x=1, x=2)
```

However, this is often accompanied by a `parse-error` for the same issue.

## bad-override

When a subclass overrides a field or method of its base class, care must be taken that the override won't cause problems.

Some of these are obvious:

```python
class Base:
  def f(self, a: int) -> None:
    pass

class NoArg(Base):
  def f(self) -> None:
    pass

class WrongType(Base):
  def f(self, a: str) -> None:
    pass

def uses_f(b: Base) -> None:
  b.f(1)
```

These errors are rather obvious: `uses_f` will fail if given a `NoArg` or `WrongType` instance, because those methods don't expect an `int` argument!

The guiding idea here is the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle), the idea that a subclass can stand in for a base class at any point without breaking the program.

This can be a little subtle at first blush. Consider:

```python
class Base:
  def f(self, a: int) -> None:
    pass

class Sub(Base):
  def f(self, a: float) -> None:
    pass
```

Is this OK? Yes! `int` is treated as a subclass of `float`, or to put it another way, a function that accepts `float` can accept every `int`.
That means everywhere that we call `Base.f` can safely call `Sub.f`.

The opposite case, where `Base.f` takes `float` and `Sub.f` takes `int`, is an error because `Sub.f` cannot accept every `float` value.

## bad-return

Arises when a function does not return a value that is compatible with the function's return type annotation.

```python
def bad_return() -> None:
  return 1
```

Real-world examples are often less obvious, of course, due to complex control flow and type relationships.

This error is also raised for generator functions:

```python
from typing import Generator
# Generator has 3 types: the yield, send, and return types.
def bad_gen() -> Generator[int, None, str]:
  yield 1
  return 2  # should be a str!
```

## bad-specialization

"Specialization" refers to instantiating a generic type with a concrete type.
For example, `list` is a generic type, and `list[int]` is that type specialized with `int`.

Each generic type has an expected number of type vars, and each type var can be bound or constrained.
Attempting to use specialize a generic type in a way that violates these specifications will result in a `bad-specialization` error:

```python
x: list[int, str]
```

## bad-typed-dict

This error is reported when a `TypedDict` definition includes an unsupported keyword argument.
According to the typing specification, the only keyword argument allowed in a `TypedDict`'s
base class list is `total`.

```python
from typing import TypedDict

# This is an error because `foo` is not a valid keyword.
class InvalidTD(TypedDict, foo=1):
    x: int

# This is valid.
class ValidTD(TypedDict, total=False):
    x: int
```

## bad-unpacking

An error caused by unpacking, such as attempting to unpack a list, tuple, or iterable into the wrong number of variables.

```python
def two_elems() -> tuple[int, str]:
  return (1, "two")

a, b, c = two_elems()
```

Note that pyrefly can only report this error if it knows how many elements the thing being unpacked has.

```python
# A bare `tuple` could have any number of elements
def two_elems() -> tuple:
  return (1, "two")

a, b, c = two_elems()
```

## delete-error

This error occurs when attempting to `del` something that cannot be deleted.

Besides obvious things like built-in values (you can't `del True`!), some object attributes are protected from deletion.
For example, read-only and required `TypedDict` fields cannot be deleted.

## deprecated

This error occurs on usage of a deprecated class or function:

```python
from warnings import deprecated
@deprecated("deprecated")
def f(): ...
f()  # deprecated!
```

## implicitly-defined-attribute

An attribute was implicitly defined by assignment to `self` in a method that we
do not recognize as always executing. (We recognize constructors and some test
setup methods.)

```python
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0  # no error, `__init__` always executes
    def f(self):
        self.y = 0  # error, `y` may be undefined if `f` does not execute
```

## import-error

An error related to the import mechanism, such as when a module cannot be found.

The error message will include which paths were searched, such as the site package paths.
You may be missing a dependency, or you may need to inform Pyrefly where the module lives. See [Configuration](configuration.mdx) for further information.

## index-error

Attempting to access a container with an incorrect index.
This only occurs when Pyrefly can statically verify that the index is incorrect, such as with a fixed-length tuple.

```python
def add_three(x: tuple[int, int]) -> int:
  return x[0] + x[1] + x[2]
```

Pyrefly also knows the keys of `TypedDict`s, but those have their own error kind.

## internal-error

Ideally you'll never see this one. If you do, please consider [filing a bug](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).

## invalid-annotation

There are several reasons why an annotation may be invalid. The most common case is misusing a typing special form, such as `typing.Final`, `typing.ClassVar`, `typing.ParamSpec`, and so on.

```python
from typing import *

# Final must have a value
a: Final
# ClassVar can only be used in a class body
b: ClassVar[int] = 1
```

The error messages will explain how the special form is being misused. Consult the [typing docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and [typing spec](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/) for more information.

## invalid-argument

This error is used to indicate an issue with an argument to special typing-related functions.

For example, `typing.NewType` is a handy special form for creating types that are distinct from a base type.


```python
from typing import *

# The first arg must match the name!
Mismatch = NewType("Wrong Name", int)

# NewTypes cannot be used in isinstance.
UserId = NewType("UserId", int)
if isinstance(1, UserId):
  ...
```

## invalid-inheritance

An error caused by incorrect inheritance in a class or type definition.
This can pop up in quite a few cases:
- Trying to subclass something that isn't a class.
- Subclassing a type that does not support it, such as a `NewType` or a `Final` class.
- Attempting to mix `Protocol`s with non-`Protocol` base classes.
- Trying to make a generic enum.
- Trying to give a `TypedDict` a metaclass.

And so on!

## invalid-literal

`typing.Literal` only allows a [limited set](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/literal.html#legal-parameters-for-literal-at-type-check-time) of types as parameters.
Attempting to use `Literal` with anything else is an error.

```python
from typing import Literal

# These are legal
Literal[1.0]
Literal['a', 'b', 'c']
# This is not
class A:
  ...
Literal[A()]
```

## invalid-overload

The `@overload` decorator requires that the decorated function has at least two overloaded signatures and a base implementation.

```python
from typing import *

@overload
def no_base(x: int) -> None:
  pass

@overload
def no_base(x: str) -> int:
  pass
```

```python
@overload
def just_one(x: int) -> None:
  pass

def just_one(x: str) -> None:
  ...
```


## invalid-param-spec

This error is reported when `typing.ParamSpec` is defined incorrectly or misused. For example:

```python
from typing import *

P = ParamSpec("Name Must Match!")

P1 = ParamSpec("P1")
P2 = ParamSpec("P2")

def f(x, *args: P1.args, **kwargs: P2.kwargs) -> None:
  pass
```

Here, `P1.args` and `P2.kwargs` can't be used together; `*args` and `**kwargs` must come from the same `ParamSpec`.

## invalid-super-call

`super()` has [a few restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) on how it is called.

`super()` can be called without arguments, but only when used inside a method of a class:

```python
class Legal(Base1, Base2):
  def f(self) -> None:
    super().f()

def illegal(arg: SomeType) -> None:
  super().f()
```

When the function is called with two arguments, like `super(T, x)`, then `T` must be a type, and the second argument is either an object where `isinstance(x, T)` is true
or a type where `issubclass(x, T)` is true.

## invalid-syntax

This error covers syntactical edge cases that are not flagged by the parser.

For example:

```python
x: list[int] = [0, 2, 3]
x[0]: int = 1
```

It's not a parse error for an assignment to have an annotation, but it is forbidden by the type checker to annotate assignment to a subscript like `x[0]`.

## invalid-type-var

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVar. A few examples:

```python
from typing import TypeVar
# Old-style TypeVars must be assigned to a matching variable.
Wrong = TypeVar("Name")

# PEP 695-style TypeVars can be constrained, but there must be at least two:
def only_one_constraint[T: (int,)](x: T) -> T:
  ...

# It's also illegal to mix the two styles together.
T = TypeVar("T")
def mixed[S](a: S, b: T) -> None:
  ...
```

## invalid-type-var-tuple

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVarTuple.

TypeVarTuple has similar error cases to [TypeVar](#invalid-type-var), but also a few of its own. For example:

```python
from typing import TypeVarTuple

Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")

# TypeVarTuples must always be unpacked:
bad: tuple[Ts] = (...)
good: tuple[*Ts] = (...)

# Only one TypeVarTuple is allowed in a list of type arguments:
def two_tups[*Xs, *Ys](xs: tuple[*Xs], ys: tuple[*Ys]) -> None:
  ...
```

## invalid-yield

This error arises when `yield` is used in a way that is not allowed. For example:

```python
from typing import Generator

for _ in range(1, 10):
  yield "can't yield outside of a function!"

def bad_yield_from() -> Generator[int, None, None]:
  # `yield from` can only be used with iterables.
  yield from 1
```

## match-error

This error is used in two cases.

The first is when there is an issue with a `match` statement. For example, `Ex` only has 2 fields but the `case` lists 3:

```python
class Ex:
  __match_args__ = ('a', 'b')
  def __init__(self, a: int, b: str) -> None:
    self.a = a
    self.b = b

def do(x: Ex) -> None:
  match x:
    case Ex(a, b, c):
      print("This is an error")
```

It is also used when `__match_args__` is defined incorrectly. It must be a tuple of the names of the class's attributes as literal strings.
For class `Ex` in the previous example, `__match_args__ = ('a', 'c')` would be an error because `Ex.c` does not exist.

## missing-argument

An error caused by calling a function without all the required arguments.

```python
def takes_two(x: int, y: int) -> int:
  return x + y

takes_two(1)
```

## missing-attribute

This error is raised when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on the given object or module.

In the case of modules, attempting to import an nonexistent name will raise [`missing-module-attribute](#missing-module-attribute) instead.

```python
import os
from os import bacarat  # missing-module-attribute
os.jongleur()  # missing-attribute
```

Note that objects with type `Any` will never raise this error.

## missing-module-attribute

Arises when attempting to import a name that does not exist from a module.

This is distinct from [`import-error`](#import-error), which is used when the module being imported does not exist, and [`missing-attribute`](#missing-attribute), when access attributes of the module.

```python
import this_does_not_exist  # import-error
import os.bacarat  # import-error
from os import joker  # missing-module-attribute
os.perkeo  # missing-attribute
```

In this example, `os.bacarat` is treated as a module name, so failing to find it results in an `import-error`.
`from os import joker` does not tell us if `joker` is a module, class, function, etc., so it is treated as the more general `missing-module-attribute`.

## no-access

The `no-access` error indicates that an attribute exists, but it cannot be used in this way.

For example, classes do not have access to their instances' attributes:

```python
class Ex:
  def __init__(self) -> None:
    self.meaning: int = 42

del Ex.meaning  # no-access
```

## no-matching-overload

This error is similar to the other bad function call errors, but specifically for cases where a function decorated with `@overload` is called with arguments that do not match any of the overloaded variations.

For example, neither of the signatures of `f` can take an argument of type `float`:

```python
from typing import overload

@overload
def f(x: int) -> int:
    ...

@overload
def f(x: str) -> str:
    ...

def f(x: int | str) -> int | str:
    return x

f(1.0)
```

## not-a-type

This indicates an attempt to use something that isn't a type where a type is expected.
In most cases, a more specific error kind is used.

You may see this error around incorrect type aliases:

```python
class A:
  ...
# Not an alias, just a string!
X = "A"
x: X = ...  # X is not a type alias, so this is illegal
```

## not-callable

A straightforward error: something that is not a function was used as if it were a function.

One interesting place this error may occur is with decorators:

```python
x = 1

@x  # not-callable
def foo() -> None:
  ...
```

## not-iterable

This is most likely to be seen in a `for` loop:

```python
x = 1  # Or some other value
for val in x:  # not-iterable
  ...
```

## parse-error

An error related to parsing or syntax. This covers a variety of cases, such as function calls with duplicate keyword args, some poorly defined functions, and so on.

## read-only

This error indicates that the attribute being accessed does exist but cannot be modified.

For example, a `@property` with no setter cannot be assigned to:

```python
class Ex:
    @property
    def meaning(self) -> int:
        return 42

x = Ex()
x.meaning = 0
```

## reveal-type

Pyrefly uses this error to communicate the output of the [`reveal_type`](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#reveal-type) function.

## type-alias-error

An error related to the definition or usage of a `typing.TypeAlias`. Many of these cases are covered by [`invalid-annotation`](#invalid-annotation), so this error
specifically handles illegal type alias values:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias
x = 2
Bad: TypeAlias = x
```

## typed-dict-key-error

This error arises when `TypedDict`s are used with incorrect keys, such as a key that does not exist in the `TypedDict`.

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class Ex(TypedDict):
    a: int
    b: str

def test(x: Ex) -> None:
    # These two keys don't exist
    x.nope
    x["wrong"]
    # TypedDict keys must be strings!
    x[1]
```

## unbound-name

This error corresponds to the runtime `NameError`, indicating that a variable is referenced but does not exist.

```python
def do_things(stuff: list[int]) -> str:
  ...

do_thing([1, 2])  # typo! Or, unbound-name
```

## unexpected-keyword

A function was called with an extra keyword argument.

```python
def two_args(a: int, b: int) -> int:
  ...

two_args(a=1, b=2, c=3)
```

## unknown-name

`unknown-name` occurs when attempting to load a name from another scope, but the name cannot be found.

```python
def where() -> None:
  # There is no spoon: unknown-name
  global spoon
```

## unsupported

This error indicates that pyrefly does not currently support a typing feature.

## unsupported-operand

This error arises when attempting to perform an operation between values of two incompatible types.
Since many Python operators are actually syntactic sugar for function calls, many operations will result in [`bad-argument-type`](#bad-argument-type) errors.

An exception is the `in` operator, which fails when looking for a value in something that does not support `in`:

```python
if "hello" in 1:  # int doesn't support `in`!
  ...
```
